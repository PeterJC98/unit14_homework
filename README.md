Summarising Model Performance 
* Which model had the lowest loss?

The model based off closing prices had the lowest loss. 
* Which model tracks actual values best over time?

Also the model based off closing prices. The model based purely off the fear and greed index did not adapt to large changes in the asset price and would keep predictions close to the assets inital value
* How did window size effect the model

Generally decreasing the window size didnt effect the models that much, considering the models arent very good to begin with its hard to see the impact of change in parameters. There was a tiny bit higher loss and the model would train faster
